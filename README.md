Playing around with creating a CLI for leetcode questions, similar to rustlings. Just started so much mess.

    1. create list of exercises
2. Convert curl command plus pipeline into a nushell command with params
3. Factor out tokens into an ENV variable so I can push to GH
4. Figure out where the empty fn and signature are (which curl request)
